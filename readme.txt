ToxiScan is a little Streamlit app that spots hateful or toxic language in any URL, pasted text, or TXT file. 
Under the hood it uses Playwright to fully render pages, then a fine-tuned BERT model to label passages (and even individual words) as Toxic, Obscene, Insult, Threat, Hate, or Highly Toxic. 
Just hit “Analyze” and dive into expandable sections showing flagged snippets and the exact words that set off alarm bells.
